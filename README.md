This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.

*NOTE: This repo originally came from https://github.com/notrab/create-react-app-redux.git. I have stripped it down slightly and changed the folder structure a little bit.
